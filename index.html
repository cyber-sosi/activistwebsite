        <h1>What Is Climate Change</h1>
        <br>
        <p>You may have encountered this term several times before but are still wondering what it means exactly. Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil, and gas), which produces heat-trapping gases.</p>
